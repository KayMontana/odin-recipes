# odin-recipes
In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished. Not unless you’re into brutalist web design, that is.

I just built my lasagna recipe and the hardest part was actually thinking up the recipe. I had a pretty easy time with the actual code. Another small challenge was figuring out the repository stuff, but by the end I got it all down. Fun project, didn't take long. Overall 8/10. Would have been 10 but I think there will be better down the line.
