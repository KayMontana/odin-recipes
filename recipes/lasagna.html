    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

        <ul>
            <li> Lasagna Noodles </li>
            <li> Ground Beef </li>
            <li> Tomato Sauce </li>
            <li> Onions </li>
            <li> Red Peppers </li>
            <li> Yellow Peppers </li>
            <li> Salt </li>
            <li> Cottage Cheese </li>
            <li> Mozarella Cheese </li>
        </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> First, you need to prepare your sauce. Put your ground beef in a pot and cook it up with a good
                amount of tomato sauce. Add onions for taste and add red and yellow peppers to make it more
                colorful and add some texture. Add some salt to the mix for extra taste, and any other 
                seasonings you may like. </li>

                <br>
            
            <li> Second, you need to build your lasagna. I like to do this in layers. One layer, from bottom to top
                goes like this: Meat Sauce, Noodle, Meat Sauce, Mozzarella Cheese, Cottage Cheese, Noodle.
                You want to build at least two layers of that, depending how tall of a lasagna you want. Be sure to 
                add more mozarella on top to melt in and give the lasagna look. </li>

                <br>

            <li> Third and finally, you want to bake your lasagna. You should bake it at 350 degrees for roughly 45 
                minutes. Then you let it cool and serve it up!! </li>
        </ol>
