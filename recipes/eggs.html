    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p> Now, I'm going to go ahead and be honest. I feel as though I have a solid hold over this recipe
        project. I think I've done a good job considering my current knowledge. I think I finished this 
        in less than two hours and that seemed good from my POV. I don't think I need to make three pages.
        I made two and I will more than likely half-ass this one. Scrambled eggs seem like the easiest
        thing to make, so here we are. </p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <p> Egg <br><br> Black Pepper <br><br> Salt <br><br> Milk </p>

    <h2> Steps </h2>

            <li> First, you need to prepare your eggs. You should crack your desired amount of eggs into a bowl, 
                so you can beat them. Beat them, and then add salt and pepper. I prefer my eggs pretty salty. Add milk
                to make your eggs a little more fluffy when they are finished. </li>

                <br><br><br>
            
            <li> Second, you need to cook your eggs. Once again, I use a frying pan. No sidewalk or any fancy bullshit.
                I pour my eggs into the pan, and I use a spoon to scramble them. When it cooks a bit and starts to stick
                to the pan, that's when you use the spoon to scrape the egg and scramble it around and make it all nice. </li>

                <br><br><br>

            <li> Finally, put your finished scrambled eggs in a plate. EAT. </li>
        </ol>

        <style>
            li,
            p {
                font-size: 20px;
                font-weight: 300;
            }
        </style>
